<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: December 4, 2025</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Santa Chaos ("we," "our," or "us") handles information in connection with your use of the Santa Chaos mobile application (the "Service"). This policy is intended to inform you about the data we access and use.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect and Use</h2>
    <p>Our application is designed to provide a specific user experience. Based on the permissions requested by the application, we may access the following:</p>
<p>• In-App Billing Services: The application uses the com.android.vending.BILLING permission to manage in-app purchases through the Google Play Store. This service is essential for unlocking features or content within the app. All billing transactions are processed securely by Google, and we do not collect or store your sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers. The Google Play Billing Library is used to handle these transactions.</p>
<p>• Device State: The application requests the android.permission.WAKE_LOCK permission. This allows the app to prevent the device from going to sleep to ensure an uninterrupted user experience during specific activities within the app. This permission does not grant us access to any personal data but is used solely to control the device's power state while the app is active.</p>
<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share personal data with third parties, as the application does not collect personal information. Any data related to in-app purchases is handled directly by the Google Play Store.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>We are committed to ensuring your information is secure. While our application itself does not store personal data, we rely on the security measures provided by the Android operating system and the Google Play Store for handling in-app billing.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our Service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.</p>
<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us on Google Play.</p>
